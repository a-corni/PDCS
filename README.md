# PDCS
Project Quantum Computing : Pauli Decomposition over Commuting Subsets
Developed in a group of 3 under the supervision of Zeno Toffano
Objective : generating all commutative subsets of Pauli operators in order to implement an optimisation algorithm decomposing any unitary gates over commutative subsets of Pauli matrices.
